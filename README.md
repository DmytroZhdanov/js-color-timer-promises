# js-color-timer-promises

These tasks require implementing a color switcher, a countdown timer, and a dynamic promise generator, incorporating flatpickr for date selection and possibly notiflix for notifications.

- Task 1 involves a color switcher. Create functionality that changes the background color of the body element to a random color every second when the 'Start' button is clicked. Implement a 'Stop' button to halt the color change.

- Task 2 focuses on creating a countdown timer. Utilize flatpickr library for date selection and build a timer that counts down to the selected date in the format of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

- Task 3 revolves around creating promises dynamically based on user inputs. Design a form that accepts delay values, steps, and amounts, and upon submission, generates a corresponding number of promises that either resolve or reject randomly after the specified delay.
